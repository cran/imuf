Description: Estimate the orientation of an inertial measurement unit 
    (IMU) with a 3-axis accelerometer and a 3-axis gyroscope using a 
    complementary filter. 'imuf' takes an IMU's accelerometer and gyroscope 
    readings, time duration, its initial orientation, and a gain factor as 
    inputs, and returns an estimate of the IMU's final orientation.
